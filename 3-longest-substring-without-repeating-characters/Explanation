Intuition
The problem requires finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. The challenge is to efficiently track characters and ensure no duplicates exist in the current window of the string being considered.

Approach
To solve this problem, we can use the sliding window technique, which is optimal for substring-related problems. The idea is to maintain a window of characters that doesn't contain any duplicates. Here's the step-by-step approach:

Initialize a Set and Pointers: Use a set to keep track of characters in the current window. Initialize two pointers, left and right, to represent the start and end of the window, respectively. Also, initialize max_length to store the result.

Expand the Window: Move the right pointer to include new characters in the window. For each new character at s[right], check if it's already in the set.

Handle Duplicates: If the character is found in the set, it means there's a duplicate. Move the left pointer to the right, removing characters from the set until the duplicate character is no longer in the set.

Update the Set and Maximum Length: Add the current character to the set and update max_length if the current window size (right - left + 1) is larger than the previously recorded maximum.

Return the Result: After processing all characters, max_length will hold the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed exactly once by the right pointer and at most once by the left pointer.

Space complexity:
O(min(m,n)), where m is the size of the character set (e.g., ASCII characters). In the worst case, the set can store all unique characters of the string.
